* The SWC morphology samples of brain vasculature are available from the [Brain Vasculature (BraVa) database](http://cng.gmu.edu/brava). 
The Brain Vasculature (BraVa) database contains digital reconstructions of the human brain arterial 
arborizations from 61 healthy adult subjects along with extracted morphological measurements.
The arterial arborizations include the six major trees stemming from the circle of Willis, 
namely: the left and right Anterior Cerebral Arteries (ACAs), Middle Cerebral Arteries (MCAs), 
and Posterior Cerebral Arteries (PCAs).
